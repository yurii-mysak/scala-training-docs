# Lakehouse Platform Benefits & Migration Plan

This guide covers two advanced topics for data platform interviews:
1. Benefits of using a single lakehouse platform versus maintaining separate data lake and data warehouse systems.
2. A step-by-step migration plan for transitioning from a legacy data warehouse to a lakehouse architecture.

## 1. Benefits of a Unified Lakehouse Platform

- **Reduced Architectural Complexity**  
  A single platform consolidates storage, compute, and metadata management, eliminating the need to integrate disparate systems for data lake and warehouse workloads.

- **Cost Efficiency**  
  By leveraging low-cost object storage and unified compute engines, organizations avoid duplicated storage and redundant processing, lowering total cost of ownership.

- **Simplified Data Governance and Security**  
  Centralized catalogs and unified access controls ensure consistent enforcement of policies, encryption, and auditing across all data assets.

- **Streamlined Data Operations**  
  Teams use the same tools and APIs for batch and streaming workloads, reducing operational overhead and simplifying training.

- **Consistent Metadata and Lineage**  
  A single metadata layer provides end-to-end visibility of data lineage, schema changes, and version history without synchronizing multiple catalogs.

- **Seamless BI and ML Workflows**  
  With ACID transactions, time travel, and performance optimizations on open formats, lakehouses serve both analytics and machine learning use cases on the same datasets.

## 2. Migration Plan: Legacy Data Warehouse to Lakehouse

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
1. **Inventory Assets**  
   Catalog existing schemas, ETL processes, dashboards, and data consumers to prioritize migration targets.

2. **Define Success Criteria**  
   Establish performance, cost, and data quality benchmarks for the lakehouse pilot.

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation
1. **Select Pilot Workloads**  
   Migrate a representative business domain to validate connectivity, performance, and compatibility.

2. **Test Query Parity**  
   Run existing BI reports and analytical queries against the lakehouse, adjusting mappings as needed.

### Phase 3: Refactoring and Development
1. **Adopt Medallion Architecture**  
   Implement Bronze, Silver, and Gold zones for raw ingestion, cleansing, and curated transformations.

2. **Convert ETL Logic**  
   Translate stored procedures and SQL scripts into portable Spark or dbt workflows.

### Phase 4: Governance and Security Setup
1. **Unified Metadata Catalog**  
   Register tables and views in a central metastore for schema management and lineage tracking.

2. **Access Control Migration**  
   Recreate IAM roles, policies, and fine-grained ACLs in the lakehouse environment.

### Phase 5: Dual-Write and Validation
1. **Parallel Writes**  
   Configure pipelines to write data simultaneously to the legacy warehouse and lakehouse.

2. **Parallel Reporting**  
   Run dashboards and models in both environments to compare results and performance.

### Phase 6: Cutover and Optimization
1. **Switch Data Consumers**  
   Redirect downstream applications, BI tools, and models to the lakehouse endpoints.

2. **Optimize and Monitor**  
   Tune partitioning, caching, and compaction; implement monitoring, alerting, and cost dashboards.

3. **Decommission Legacy Systems**  
   Archive historical snapshots and retire old infrastructure once the lakehouse is proven stable.
