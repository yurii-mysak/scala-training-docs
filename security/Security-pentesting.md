# Penetration Testing Essentials

Penetration Testing (pentesting) is a proactive security assessment method that simulates attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. Definition

**Penetration Testing**: Authorized simulated cyberattacks against systems, networks, or applications to evaluate their security posture.

- **Goal**: Identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.
- **Scope**: Can cover infrastructure, applications, APIs, wireless networks, and human factors (social engineering).

---

## 2. Pentest Targets

- **Networks**: routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs.
- **Web Applications**: HTTP endpoints, input fields, authentication.
- **APIs & Microservices**: REST/GraphQL endpoints, message brokers.
- **Mobile Applications**: Android/iOS apps and backends.
- **Cloud Environments**: AWS, Azure, GCP configurations, IAM.
- **Physical Security**: access controls, device security.
- **Social Engineering**: phishing, pretexting, tailgating.

## 3. Types of Penetration Testing

| Type             | Description                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Black Box**    | Tester has no prior knowledge of the system (external attack)  |
| **White Box**    | Full knowledge of system internals (source code, configs)     |
| **Gray Box**     | Partial knowledge (e.g., credentials but no code)             |
| **Network Pentest** | Focused on network infrastructure                        |
| **Web Application Pentest** | Focused on web app vulnerabilities                |
| **API Pentest**  | Targets application programming interfaces                     |
| **Wireless Pentest** | Tests Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IoT protocols                     |
| **Social Engineering** | Tests human vulnerabilities via phishing, impersonation |

## 4. Common Pentest Phases

1. **Planning & Reconnaissance**  
   - Define scope, rules of engagement  
   - Gather information (WHOIS, DNS, network scanning)  
2. **Scanning & Enumeration**  
   - Port scanning (Nmap), vulnerability scanning (Nessus)  
3. **Exploitation**  
   - Launch attacks to exploit vulnerabilities (Metasploit, custom scripts)  
4. **Post-Exploitation**  
   - Maintain access, pivot to other systems  
5. **Reporting & Remediation**  
   - Document findings, risk levels, remediation guidance

## 5. Tools of the Trade

| Category            | Tools                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Reconnaissance**  | Nmap, Recon-ng, Amass                       |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard         |
| **Exploitation**    | Metasploit, SQLmap, Burp Suite              |
| **Web Testing**     | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite                       |
| **Wireless Testing**| Aircrack-ng, Kismet                         |
| **Password Attacks**| John the Ripper, Hashcat                    |
| **Cloud Security**  | Scout Suite, Prowler, CloudSploit           |
| **Reporting**       | Dradis, MagicTree, Serpico                  |

## 6. Best Practices

- Define clear scope and rules of engagement.  
- Use a mix of automated and manual testing.  
- Prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities.  
- Conduct regular retesting after fixes.  
- Maintain confidentiality and legal compliance.
